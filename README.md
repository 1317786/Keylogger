<h1>Keylogger</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, we will be developing a keylogger using C# and the .NET framework to capture keystrokes in real-time. The objective is to utilize the Windows API, specifically the 'SetWindowsHookEx' function, to hook into the keyboard input at a low level and log the captured keystrokes into a hidden file using C#'s file handling capabilities. This exercise will serve as an introduction to systems programming in C#, with a focus on interacting with Windows-level APIs, event-driven programming, and managing file input/output operations efficiently. <br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>C#</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Microsoft Visual Studio</b> 

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

- <b>Hands-On Application of Windows API Integration</b>: Successfully implemented a C# keylogger using the Windows API, specifically through the 'SetWindowsHookEx' function to capture keyboard inputs at a low level. This project showcased proficiency in C# by employing the Windows API for real-time keylogging, deepening understanding of systems programming.

- <b>File Handling for Efficient Logging</b>: Gained practical experience in utilizing C#â€™s file handling capabilities to log captured keystrokes securely into a hidden file. This reinforced file I/O concepts and the importance of efficiently managing data during continuous input monitoring tasks.
  
- <b>Security Awareness and Ethical Considerations</b>: Enhanced awareness of the ethical implications associated with keylogging, learning the dual-use nature of such tools in cybersecurity and recognizing the importance of transparency and ethical use of software in monitoring environments.
