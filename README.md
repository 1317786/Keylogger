<h1>Keylogger</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, we will be developing a keylogger using C# and the .NET framework to capture keystrokes in real-time. The objective is to utilize the Windows API, specifically the 'SetWindowsHookEx' function, to hook into the keyboard input at a low level and log the captured keystrokes into a hidden file using C#'s file handling capabilities. This exercise will serve as an introduction to systems programming in C#, with a focus on interacting with Windows-level APIs, event-driven programming, and managing file input/output operations efficiently. <br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>C#</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Microsoft Visual Studio</b> 

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

- <b>Hands-On Application of Windows API Integration</b>: Successfully implemented a C# keylogger using the Windows API, specifically through the 'SetWindowsHookEx' function to capture keyboard inputs at a low level. This project showcased proficiency in C# by employing the Windows API for real-time keylogging, deepening understanding of systems programming.

- <b>File Handling for Efficient Logging</b>: Gained practical experience in utilizing C#’s file handling capabilities to log captured keystrokes securely into a hidden file. This reinforced file I/O concepts and the importance of efficiently managing data during continuous input monitoring tasks.
  
- <b>Security Awareness and Ethical Considerations</b>: Enhanced awareness of the ethical implications associated with keylogging, learning the dual-use nature of such tools in cybersecurity and recognizing the importance of transparency and ethical use of software in monitoring environments.






<h2>Demo:</h2>

<p align="center">
In this concise demonstration, we initiate the keylogger to observe its real-time tracking capabilities. The video begins with the activation of the keylogger, followed by the opening of a Notepad window where I type sample text. Subsequently, I conduct a Google search to illustrate the keylogger’s ability to record browser interactions. The demo progresses with an attempt to log into a social media platform, highlighting the keylogger’s effectiveness in capturing sensitive input such as passwords—which appear in the keylogger's logs but remain concealed on the login screen. The demonstration concludes by revealing the log file where all keystrokes are securely recorded, showcasing the comprehensive surveillance capacity of the keylogger.<br/>
